purescript-dygraphs
===================

Purescript bindings to [dygraphs](http://www.dygraphs.com/) plotting library.

See the linked homepage for documentation on using and configuring dygraphs.

These bindings were written for dygraphs version 1.1.0.

Examples of purescript-dygraphs in action are in the `examples` directory. The
html file will not render any graphs until the `grunt` command is run to build
the required `Examples.js` file.

`pscDocs` output is available in the `docs` directory.
